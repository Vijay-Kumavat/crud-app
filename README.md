# Task Manager
 The provided ReactJS code implements a Task Management System. It consists of three main sections: 

1. **Insert**: The ReactJS code allows users to create new tasks by filling out a form with task details, which are then added to the task list displayed on the screen.

2. **Update**: Users can update existing tasks by selecting a task from the list, editing its details, and saving the changes, which will update the task directly in the list.

3. **Delete**: The application provides an option to delete tasks, allowing users to remove unwanted tasks from the list with a simple click, instantly reflecting the change.

The ReactJS Task Manager app enables users to easily manage their tasks by providing an intuitive interface for creating, updating, and deleting tasks. It allows users to organize their to-do list efficiently, with real-time updates to reflect any changes made. The app offers a seamless experience for tracking task progress and keeping projects organized.
